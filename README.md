# SVM-Support-Vector-Machine-
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
By applying a non-linear mapping, it allows SVMs to find a decision boundary that separates different classes more effectively. In other words, the kernel function measures the similarity or proximity between data points in the transformed feature space.
The primary objective of an SVM is to find a decision boundary that maximally separates the data points of different classes. This decision boundary is called the "hyperplane" and is represented as a subspace with one dimension less than the original data space. In two dimensions, the hyperplane is a line, while in higher dimensions, it is a hyperplane.
There are different types of SVMs based on the nature of the classification problem: - Linear SVM,Non-linear SVM,Support Vector Regression (SVR)
SVMs offer several advantages: SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and can handle datasets with a large number of features, They have a solid mathematical foundation and are less prone to overfitting, The use of the margin allows SVMs to be robust against outliers,Through the kernel trick, SVMs can capture non-linear relationships in the data.
